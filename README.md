# Modelling of Complex Systems - projects
The projects are from the course **Modelling of Complex Systems**, taught in KU Leuven. The assignments date from the year 2015-2016.

The first project is an implementation in [**IDP**](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/software/idp), a knowledge base system for the FO(.) language. The solution.idp file is the implementation of Skeleton.idp. Everything in idp_workdir/ was provided by the team of KU Leuven. The visualisation that was provided has been left out due to copyright. The main procedure may need a slight adjustment because of this.

The second project is implemented in Event-B and tests knowledge about LTL and CTL.
